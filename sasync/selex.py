"""
Convenient select-object useage for asynchronous database
transactions via SQLAlchemy.


About sAsync
============
B{sAsync} is an enhancement to the SQLAlchemy package that provides
persistent item-value stores, arrays, and dictionaries, and an access
broker for conveniently managing database access, table setup, and
transactions. Everything can be run in an asynchronous fashion using
the Twisted framework and its deferred processing capabilities.
